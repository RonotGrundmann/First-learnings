# First-learnings

In this repository I'll be adding the codes I've been writing while learning Ruby on Rails along with programming logic.
I'm also planning to learn GIT/GITHUB features and data base in SQL after a while. 

So, that's the five step basics learning program to back-end development I'm taking on account now:

 1 - Programming logic;
 2 - Programming language (Ruby), focusing on Object Orientation;
 3 - Framework (Rails);
 4 - GIT/GITHUB;
 5 - Data Base (PostgreSQL, mySQL);

Besides, I'm also taking a typing course to improve my speed at this. I'm looking to improve my english skills soon.

I'm basing this directory on the Back-end Roadmap found in https://roadmap.sh/backend/ , wich I think is a good basis to get along.

Things to learn before to take my first employ: CRUD, Filters, Data base relations, Negotiation rules and Report.
