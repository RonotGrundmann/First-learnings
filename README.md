# First-learnings

In this repository I'll be adding the codes written while learning Ruby on Rails along with programming logic. Expect some Html, Css, JavaScript (to front end basics knowlege) and Python codes too.

I divided the back end development learning path in these 5 general breaks:

 1 - Programming logic;
 2 - Programming language (Ruby, Object Oriented);
 3 - Framework (Rails);
 4 - GIT/GITHUB;
 5 - Data Base (PostgreSQL, mySQL);

Besides, I'm also taking a typing course.

This learnir program is based on the Back-end Roadmap found in https://roadmap.sh/backend/ . Hello Odin! Taking a look on The Odin Project, it's awesome!

Some important things to learn alongside: CRUD, Filters, Data base relations, Negotiation rules and Report.
